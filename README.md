### Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Overview
We are analyzing how Amazon reviews change depending on whether they are written by members of the Vine program or not. Using PySPark, we perform ETL on the data to extract, transform, and load the data into an AWS RDS instance and calculate different meterics. Specifically, we are focusing on the US reviews for video games. 

# Results

There are 94 vine reviews adn 40471 non-vine reviews. 

There are 48 5-star vine reviews and 15,663 5-star vine reviews .

The percentage of vine reviews that were 5 stars was 51.063 % and the percentage for non-vine was 38.7%.

# Summary
51% of reviews in vine were 5 stars whereas non-vine members only gave 5 stars 39% of the time. Thus, there is a bias for reviews in the Vine program. We could also analyze the descriptive statistics of the data such as mean, mediam, and mode for vine vs non-vine reviews.
